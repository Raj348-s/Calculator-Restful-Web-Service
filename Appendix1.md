Abstract: Many organizations migrate their on-premise infrastructure to the cloud for its known advantages such as low cost and flexibility. However, cloud computing also introduces new challenges for incident response due to the distributed nature of cloud systems and the limited knowledge of cloud computing infrastructure. In this study, we explore the challenges and opportunities of incident response in cloud computing and suggest additional steps to be added to the traditional incident response plan in the context of cloud computing.

Title: Secure Access Service Edge: A Zero Trust Based Framework For Accessing Data Securely
Author(s): Silafu Yiliyaer, Yoohwan Kim
Affiliation(s): Department of Computer Science, University of Nevada Las Vegas, Las Vegas, NV 89154, USA
Abstract: With the growing demand for moving work from home, organizations need to allow more workers to access their private networks through the employer’s local Internet. This leads to higher costs to enforce the homeworker access to the organization’s resources privately and securely through designated devices and services. Secure Access Service Edge, a framework that bundles many networks utility and security functions at the edge of the cloud to reduce the cost and maintenance for organizations to deploy their network strategy. It also boosts the connection performance of different services for remote workers. SASE uses Zero Trust Architecture as its backbone, without trusting any device or user but authenticate and authorize at each request. Direct the traffic with SD-WAN to the resource. Applying checkpoint functions like Secure Web Gateway and Cloud Access Security Broker to further enforce the security of the organization’s assets that lie in the cloud. By the end of this paper, you will understand how those techniques mentioned before work together under the SASE framework to improve organizations’ network connections and security.

Title: Maintaining Control over Distributed Data through a Data Sovereignty Model
Author(s): Andreas Riel, Christian Brecher, and Sebastian Scholze
Affiliation(s): RWTH Aachen University, Germany
Abstract: This PDF proposes a data sovereignty model that provides data owners with transparency about the location of their stored data and ensures sovereignty over their own data. The model includes legal regulations and technical measures that enable data owners to control what happens to design data and control where data is going. The model also includes the generation of usage licenses and their attachment to distributed data, which allows data owners to maintain control over their data and its usage. The PDF also proposes a data sovereignty graph that determines the physical location of data stored in a cloud and usage licenses to provide the data owner with control over where their data is distributed and with what rights. The graph represents a meta structure that still needs to be implemented and filled with specific information.
Publication details: The PDF was published in the Proceedings of the 2018 IEEE International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management (IEEM), December 16-19, 2018, Bangkok, Thailand.
